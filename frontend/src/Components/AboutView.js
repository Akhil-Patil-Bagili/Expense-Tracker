      <h1>About Akhil Patil Bagili</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Akhil, and first off, thank you for visiting my website. Born and raised in India, I've since made San Jose my home, where I currently pursue my passion for computer science at San Jose State University. My friends describe me as honest and witty, albeit a bit introverted, and that's a description I proudly wear. Let me share a little more about the person behind the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a young age, programming languages intrigued me. There's something about writing code that has always felt like magic to me. The thrill of typing lines of code and then seeing them spring to life is unmatched. And while coding is my first love, I have other interests that make me who I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working or studying, I often find myself immersed in podcasts or YouTube videos. I must admit, the allure of online gaming often sweeps me away, and if you're ever looking for a teammate, you know where to find me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Books like Atomic Habits have had a profound impact on my thinking and perspective. While I enjoy the intellectual stimulation of a good book, nothing beats the thrill of a crime movie or the humor of a comedy. And yes, pop music is often the backdrop to my life, accompanying me through highs and lows.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aspirations extend beyond just coding. I envision building full-stack applications that bring about transformative changes in the tech industry. Incorporating Artificial Intelligence is definitely on my radar because, as I see it, the future is intertwined with AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, that's a little about me, beyond the codes and algorithms. If you'd like to connect, discuss projects, or even talk about the latest pop music hit, don't hesitate to reach out!
